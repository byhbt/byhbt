### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Web Developer in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I love building software that makes life easier and healthier.

My favorite languages are Ruby and Elixir. I also enjoy building mobile applications with Flutter and some DevOps stuff like CI, CD... 

Besides programming, I also enjoy playing sports (Table Tennis, Badminton, and Running)
